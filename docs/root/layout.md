# Layout

The Merlin Labs responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and a set of determined breakpoints, ensuring consistency across layouts.

## Breakpoints

Layouts using 4-column, 8-column, and 12-column grids are available for use across different screens, devices, and orientations. The grid can also accommodate designs that would otherwise not fall on the predefined columns via fixed grids, read further on for more info on this.
